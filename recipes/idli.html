    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Idli is a popular South Indian dish made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). 
        These soft, fluffy cakes are traditionally steamed and served hot, often accompanied by chutneys, 
        sambar, or other side dishes. Idlis are known for their light texture and subtle, slightly tangy flavor, 
        making them a staple breakfast item in many South Indian households. They are also favored for their 
        nutritional benefits, being low in fat and high in protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins, making them a delicious, while 
        balanced meal option.</p>
